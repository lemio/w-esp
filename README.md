 The W-esp is a toolkit that enables the first and second year students of secondary education to connect sensors and actuators to the internet and create interactive systems that use the internet of things. This could be for example a locker that is controlled by your mobile phone, a system that prevent your grandmother from sleepwalking, automatically feeds the chickens… the sky is the limit.

The process of building such a system consists of three steps. First the w-esp needs to know which sensors and actuators are connected to the board, by using a drag and drop system [see step 1] the user can drop the in- and output icons on the different ports. After doing that the hardware needs to be physically connected to the w-esp [step 2]. Now the students can open a flow chart programming system based on Node-red(IBM) [step 3] in which they can flows consisting of input blocks, output blocks and processing blocks.

I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. – R.P. Feynman

In this way the children can learn about programming concepts, without the need to learn difficult syntaxes and languages, they also can use the internet (social media, mobile phone) as in or output and in this way create awesome projects.
