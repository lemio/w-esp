Go to settings in Google Chrome

Go to extensions

Select Load unpacked extension

-> Select the w-esp-chrome-app folder

When you browse to apps (chrome://apps/ , in my case in the left top corner) the w-esp app should be visible. First connect the w-esp and afterwards start the app. This app uses the Serial port and might not properly close it, so if you want to use ESPlorer afterwards, unplug the w-esp and plug it in. 

The app still needs a lot of documentation and more proper file index...
